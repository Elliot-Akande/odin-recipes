Odin Recipes
------------

This is an *incredibly* basic website made from a simple home page with links to various pages containing recipes for food.

I created this project to practice using very basic elements of HTML such as: 

 - Images
 - Headers
 - Paragraphs
 - Ordered Lists
 - Unordered Lists 
 - Hyperlinks
 
 *All recipes & images taken from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)*
