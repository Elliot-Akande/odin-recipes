Odin Recipes
------------

This is an *incredibly* basic website made up of a simple home page with links to various pages containing recipes for food.

I created this project to put to practice some very basic elements of HTML such as: 

 - Inserting images
 - Headers
 - Paragraphs
 - Ordered Lists
 - Unordered Lists 
 - Hyperlinks

 All recipes & images were taken from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
